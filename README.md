## Overview

Tracking tennis shots and player movements is crucial for a variety of applications. By gathering detailed shot placement data, we can develop advanced models that aid in:

- **Strategy Reports**: Identify player tendencies and create data-driven tactics.
- **Betting Probability**: Use real-time statistics to predict match outcomes.
- **Performance Analysis**: Track improvement and compare player performance across matches.
- **Training Feedback**: Provide athletes with precise feedback to refine shot accuracy and movement patterns.

**Coordinate data** in tennis allows for deeper insights into player and ball dynamics, making it an invaluable resource for coaches, analysts, and bettors alike.

## Problem: Limited Tools for Manual Tracking

Despite the value of this data, there are few options for manually tagging and tracking tennis matches. One popular method is Jeff Sackmann's [Match Charting Project](https://www.tennisabstract.com/charting/), where volunteers chart match data on Excel. While the project has been monumental in building a tennis dataset, this approach is **time-consuming** and prone to human error, as charting string-based information in Excel can be laborious and inefficient for large datasets.

## Current Solutions: SwingVision vs Hawk-Eye

**SwingVision** is an industry leader in AI-powered tennis tracking. Unlike **Hawk-Eye**, which requires extensive hardware installation on tournament courts, SwingVision is built around video feeds from a player's smartphone or tablet. This software makes it easier for recreational and professional players alike to track shot placement, speed, and player movement in real-time, without the expensive infrastructure required for Hawk-Eye.

## Our Approach

This library provides a solution similar to SwingVision. It tracks player and ball coordinates, speeds, and movements based on video feeds, offering accessible and accurate data analysis. Whether for professional use or individual improvement, this tool leverages technology to bring tennis shot tracking to a broader audience, making it easier to develop strategies, assess performance, and enhance training without the need for extensive hardware or manual charting.
